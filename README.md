# labyrinth-frontend-00

A maze game made using React and Vite, that supports registering users, logging in, saving the current game (if logged in) and downloading previous games of the user.
The games are saved along with a name given to them by the user and the date they were first uploaded.
The game uses `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, for movement. 
The username, current level and points are displayed on the right (along with the buttons of registering, loggin in, making a new game and logging out).

You'll need to also start the backend on labyrinth-backend-00 to try the full features (registering, logging in and saving games).

## Commands

`npm/pnpm/yarn install` to install the dependencies.

`npm run dev` to run the development version of the game.

` npm run build ` to make a production build.

`npm run preview` to serve the production build pages.
